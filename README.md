# Machine-Learning-Project

Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning:
Collected datasets using hardware sensors: temperature sensor, pH sensor, and light intensity sensor to measure water properties.
Data Preprocessing: Processed raw sensor data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations and performed correlation analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Model Implementation: Trained Random Forest and Gaussian Naive Bayes machine learning models.
Classification and Prediction: Built classification models to predict water quality, based on input features.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, and comparison graphs of both algorithms.
